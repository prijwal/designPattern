## When to Use the Factory Pattern?

The **Factory Pattern** is particularly useful when:
- You have multiple objects (authentication methods in this case) that share a common interface, but each implements different functionality.
- You want to instantiate these objects conditionally based on dynamic input (e.g., user input, configuration).
- The instantiation process is complex and you want to centralize it.
